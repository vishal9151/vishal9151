Implementation tips
- Create a public repo named exactly vishal9151 and place this README.md at the root; GitHub will render it at the top of the profile automatically if the repo name matches the username.[3][1]
- Pin up to 6 repositories (visora‑new, portfolio, Svelte perf demo, Remotion demo, CMS sample, realtime integrations) and order them to mirror the resume priorities so reviewers land on the most relevant work first.[6][2]
